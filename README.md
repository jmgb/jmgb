# 👋 Hi, I'm J. Miguel

I'm an engineer and digital entrepreneur who loves **building products that make people's lives better** — especially with **AI, automation, and lightweight web stacks**.

- ⚙️ I design and build end-to-end automations (n8n, Make, custom APIs, LLMs).
- 🌐 I ship fast, production-ready web projects (Python, JavaScript, Cloudflare, HTML, CSS, Tailwind).
- 📈 I always connect tech with **real business impact**: growth, retention, and revenue.
