# 👋 Hi, I'm Miguel

I'm an engineer and digital entrepreneur with an **MBA** who loves **building products that make people's lives better** — especially with **AI, automation, and lightweight web stacks**. I combine **software engineering** with **business and product thinking**, so I'm comfortable talking about both code and unit economics.

- ⚙️ I design and build end-to-end automations (n8n, Make, custom APIs, LLMs).
- 🌐 I ship fast, production-ready web projects (Python, JavaScript, **React**, **PWAs**, Cloudflare, HTML, CSS, Tailwind).
- 📈 I always connect tech with **real business impact**: growth, retention, and revenue.

Having both a **strong engineering background** and an **MBA** makes me a good fit for roles where you need someone who can:
- Understand complex technical systems,
- Shape product strategy,
- And align everything with business goals.

---

## 💼 How I Work

- I take ideas from **scratch to production** quickly, with a strong bias for shipping.
- I care about **developer experience**, but even more about **user impact and business outcomes**.
- I bridge product, tech, and growth: it’s not just about code, but about results.
- I like working on problems where AI and automation can remove friction and create leverage.
